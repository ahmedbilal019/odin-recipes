  <h1>Creamy Chicken And Asparagus Bake</h1>
  <img src="/assets/Creamy Chicken And Asparagus Bake.webp" alt="">
  <h3>Descriptions</h3>
  <p>This creamy chicken and asparagus bake combines classic flavors for a quick and easy spring dinner.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>4 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped shallot</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
      <li>3 thyme sprigs, plus leaves for garnish</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1/2 cup creme fraiche or sour cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
     <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
     <li>Whisk together flour and granulated garlic in a shallow bowl or baking dish until combined. Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Working with 1 chicken breast at a time, dredge chicken in flour mixture to coat both sides, and shake off excess; set aside on a large plate.</li>
     <li>Heat oil and butter in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Once butter is melted and shimmering, add chicken breasts to skillet, and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate. Do not wipe skillet clean.</li>
     <li>While chicken browns, transfer remaining flour mixture to a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons chicken broth, and whisk until smooth to make a slurry; set aside until ready to use. </li>
     <li>Reduce heat under skillet to medium; add shallot, and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 30 seconds. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of skillet, about 1 minute. Stir in thyme sprigs and 1 cup broth. Gradually whisk in slurry mixture until combined; bring to a simmer around edges of skillet over medium-high. Remove skillet from heat. Add browned chicken to the skillet; arrange asparagus around chicken, and immediately transfer skillet to the preheated oven. </li>
     <li>Bake in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 165 degrees F (73 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, and divide chicken evenly among 4 plates.</li>
     <li>Stir crème fraîche and Parmesan into asparagus and broth mixture until fully combined. Spoon asparagus and cream sauce over chicken. Garnish with thyme leaves.</li>
  </ol>
